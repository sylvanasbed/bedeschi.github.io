       print *, a,b,c
       stop
       end

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sylvanasbed/bedeschi.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
